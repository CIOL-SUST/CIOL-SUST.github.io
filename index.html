        <b>Computational Intelligence and Operations Lab (CIOL)</b> is founded by <b>MD Shafiqul Islam and Azmine Toushik Wasi</b>, to accelerate <b>OR-AI combinational research</b> at SUST-IPE, filling up the current gap of ML-foocused research in the department.
      </br>
        Computational Intelligence and Operations Lab (CIOL) in Shahjalal University of Science and Technology, Sylhet, Bangladesh is a virtual research facility that focuses on the development and application of advanced artificial intelligence, machine learning, and computational techniques for solving complex problems in various domains such as manufacturing, operations research, supply chain management, logistics, and transportation. The lab's research is aimed at pushing the boundaries of artificial intelligence, machine learning, optimization, simulation, and data analytics to create innovative solutions that address real-world challenges faced by businesses and society. </br>
        With a team of highly dedicated researchers and youngsters, CIOL is committed to advancing the field of computational intelligence and developing tools and technologies that enable smarter decision-making and more efficient operations using combination of OR, ML and AI.</br>
        We, at the Computational Intelligence and Operations Lab (CIOL), recently showcased our success at <b>a NeurIPS'23 workshop</b> with an interesting approach using decision focused neural networks for inventory routing optimization. Additionally, our work on Graph Neural Networks in hate speech identification towards Islam was acknowledged at the<b> Muslims in ML Workshop NeurIPS'23</b>, and we are currently awaiting review for a benchmark supply chain graph dataset paper at <b>GCLR Workshop @AAAI'24</b>.
