      <h2>Supply Chain Prediction using GNNs</h2>
      <p>
        This project aims to leverage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model and analyze complex relationships within supply chain networks. By incorporating graph-based representations of interconnected nodes such as suppliers, manufacturers, and distributors, GNNs enable the prediction of supply chain fluctuations. This approach enhances decision-making processes by providing insights into potential disruptions, optimizing inventory management, and ultimately improving the resilience of supply chain operations in the face of uncertainties.

      <h2>Solving Constrained and Combinational Optimization Problems</h2>
      <p>
      This project aims to harness the power of neural network based learning to address complex constrained optimization problems. 
      Neural Networks enable the modeling of intricate relationships, facilitating efficient exploration of feasible solutions in different problems. This innovative approach enhances optimization processes, offering a versatile and scalable framework for tackling real-world problems with constraints, ranging from resource allocation to logistical planning.
      </p>     


      <h2>Combinational  Optimization in Operations Management</h2>
      <p>
        This work focuses on applying advanced optimization techniques to address intricate decision-making challenges in operations. By leveraging combinatorial optimization algorithms, the project aims to enhance resource allocation, scheduling, and logistical planning. This work contributes to the efficiency and effectiveness of operations management by providing solutions that optimize complex combinations of variables, leading to improved cost-effectiveness and streamlined operational processes.
