        <b>TL;DR: </b>
        This paper introduces a real-world graph dataset empowering researchers to leverage GNNs for supply chain problem-solving, enhancing production planning capabilities, with benchmark scores on six homogeneous graph tasks.

        <div class="content has-text-justified">
          <p>
            Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained traction across different domains such as transportation, bio-informatics, language processing, and computer vision. However, there is a noticeable absence of research on applying GNNs to supply chain networks. Supply chain networks are inherently graph-like in structure, making them prime candidates for applying GNN methodologies. This opens up a world of possibilities for optimizing, predicting, and solving even the most complex supply chain problems. A major setback in this approach lies in the absence of real-world benchmark datasets to facilitate the research and resolution of supply chain problems using GNNs. To address the issue, we present a real-world benchmark dataset for temporal tasks, obtained from one of the leading FMCG companies in Bangladesh, focusing on supply chain planning for production purposes. The dataset includes temporal data as node features to enable sales predictions, production planning, and the identification of factory issues. By utilizing this dataset, researchers can employ GNNs to address numerous supply chain problems, thereby advancing the field of supply chain analytics and planning.

<h3 class="title is-4">Temporal Features</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Figure 5, A particularly attractive pattern emerges: the production curve exhibits distinct and sharp fluctuations. Notably, the production unit of
  the company occasionally closes, which can be attributed
  to factors such as scheduled vacations, adjustments in the
  productâ€™s MRP rate, demand variations, and optimizations in
  transportation policies. In contrast, the other aspects of the
  graph, encompassing sales orders, delivery to distributors,
  and factory issuance, remain notably stable and consistent.
  Their minimal deviations stand in contrast to the variabilities
  characterizing the production curve, providing an insight into
  the dynamics of the supply chain activities.
  In, Figure 6, we can notice a very interesting pattern. The
  product is manufactured in large batches, with orders being
  accumulated over several days before production begins. The
  processes of delivering to distributors, handling factory issues, and fulfilling sales orders appear to be running smoothly
  and consistently. The company has opted to operate the production plant intermittently and maintain product inventory.
  When you observe straight lines in the production graph, it
  indicates that the plant is not actively engaged in production
  during those periods.

<h3 class="title is-4">Feature Co-relations</h3>
<img src="./static/images/3.jpg">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The correlation plot
portrayed in Figure 7 serves to demonstrate the ways in which
diverse subgroups of product "A" are interconnected in a
multitude of facets. It is worth noting that the relationship
between delivery to distributors and sales orders is particularly robust, whereas the production unit exhibits a distinct
and prominent correlation pattern. Furthermore, a noteworthy observation pertains to the correlation between the production quantities of two subgroups, specifically "ATWWPOO2K12P" and "ATWWPOO1K24P". Additionally, it is
worth highlighting that factory issues and sales orders similarly display correlation trends, albeit with some discernible
variations.
Upon examining the correlation plot of the "S" subgroup in
Figure 8, a distinct pattern becomes apparent: there is a significant and consistent correlation between the "SOSOO1L12P"
and "SOS500M24P" subgroups across all variables. Notably,
an intriguing observation arises in the context of sales orders,
where a majority of the products within the "S" subgroup
demonstrate a relatively higher correlation compared to delivery to distributors, factory issuances, and production.

          <h2 class="title is-3">Use cases</h2>
          
          <p>Our datasetâ€™s structural design models products as nodes, while the
            interrelationships, such as shared product groups, subgroups, production
            facilities, and storage locations, are represented as edge connections.
            This dataset equips us to apply GNNs to complex supply chain
            predicaments, such as:<br><strong>Supply chain planning</strong> involves the utilization of historical data
            pertaining to production and demand as node attributes, with the
            integration of time-related features to capture seasonality and trends.
            To enhance demand forecasting accuracy, related entitiesâ€™ influence can
            be harnessed through neighborhood nodes. The hierarchical structure of
            nodes, including product groups, subgroups, plants, and storage
            locations, can be used for hierarchy-aware forecasting. In data-scarce
            scenarios, improved forecasting can be achieved by applying transfer
            learning across nodes of the same classification.<br><strong>Product Classification</strong> involves classifying products by product
            groups, sub-groups, facilities; and also by economic profitability and
            production similarities for economic decision-making.<br><strong>Product Relation Classification</strong> involves classifying or predicting
            product relations in the supply chain graph. Product Relation detection
            involves detecting a missing edge or relation in the supply chain graph
            by a binary prediction objective.<br><strong>Supply chain optimization</strong> involves modeling goods flow between
            nodes, considering demand, lead times, and reorder points. Optimal
            routes and quantities can be recommended using edges as transportation
            links. Nodes representing plants can also aid in suggesting production
            adjustments based on demand projections, constraints, and capacity.<br><strong>Anomaly detection</strong> is achieved by contrasting predicted demand with
            actual data to identify disruptions, stockouts, or unusual demand
            spikes. Deviations in demand from aggregated neighborhood demand can
            signal inconsistencies within neighborhoods, which can be detected as
            anomalies.<br><strong>Event classification</strong> involves the training of GNNs to classify
            events based on edges and nodes, such as production capacity changes,
            new product launches, and disruptions.<br><strong>Fluctuation Detection</strong> entails training GNNs to identify and classify
            fluctuations in the network based on impacts of global price hikes,
            supply chain issues, and disruptions. Fluctuations in supply chains
            refer to disruptions that can occur due to various factors and can
            significantly impact the operations of businesses. These disruptions can
            amplify negative shocks, affecting not just the firm experiencing the
            failure, but also its suppliers and customers, and even firms in other
            parts of the production network . Using temporal data, the model can
            recognize patterns in these fluctuations over time and determine if any
            demand and supply fluctuation can occur in near future for better
            planning.<br><strong>Combinatorial</strong> and <strong>Constrained</strong> <strong>Optimization</strong> involves
            utilizing GNNs to optimize complex decision-making within the supply
            chain, considering various factors and constraints. GNNs can effectively
            model the intricate relationships between nodes and edges, enabling
            efficient allocation of resources, route planning, and inventory
            management, ultimately leading to improved performance.</p>

<p>
            <b>Heterogeneous Graphs.</b> All these tasks can be executed in
both heterogeneous and homogeneous forms. In the context
of the heterogeneous approach, the incorporation of nodes
representing distinct entities, such as products, storage locations, and production facilities, interconnected by edges
that signify their intricate relationships, becomes a pivotal
strategy. This approach facilitates the construction of a heterogeneous graph model, which effectively encapsulates the intricate web of interactions inherent in supply chain networks.
Embracing these heterogeneous models affords us the capacity to encompass the varied characteristics of different supply
chain components and their complex interdependencies. This
approach proves instrumental in addressing the multifaceted
challenges that characterize supply chain management. The
ability to comprehensively represent and analyze these heterogeneous relationships equips decision-makers with a deeper
understanding of the dynamics within the supply chain, empowering them to devise optimized strategies and adapt to
the dynamic nature of supply chain operations. In doing so,
overall supply chain performance and resilience can be significantly enhanced.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Hypergraphs.</b> Efficient task execution can also be
achieved through hypergraph models. Nodes, representing
entities like products, storage locations, and production facilities, intricately interconnect through hyperedges, capturing
the intricate relationships within supply chain networks. This
strategic use of hyperedges facilitates the construction of a
tailored hypergraph model, adept at encapsulating the complex web of interactions inherent in supply chain networks.
The adoption of hypergraph models can provide a dynamic
framework to address the diverse characteristics and intricate
interdependencies of supply chain components, serving as
a pivotal strategy for managing the multifaceted challenges
inherent in supply chain management and fostering a deeper
understanding of its dynamics, which can contribute to the
enhancement of overall supply chain performance and resilience.
